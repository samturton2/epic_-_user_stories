# Epic and User Story

## What is an epic story?
An epic is a large framework that cannot be delivered with one iteration, so has to be split into smaller ones.
They are useful as they allow the big picture and end goal of the particular project to be set out very clearly.
- Use Cases:
  - When working in a scrum framework and one of the sprints cannot be completed within the dedicated timeframe
  - when there is value in having a simple hierachy in your product backlog

## What are User stories?
User stories articulate how a software feature will value the user. The team often divides the project up into functional increments" (user stories). These stories should have non-technical language, explaining what the developers and building, why they are building, and what value it creates.
- Use Cases:
  - When programming a large project its often useful to define the project scope with user stories

## How to Epic and User Stories fit in with Agile and Scrum?
- In agile, the User story is the smallest unit of work.
- The scrum backlog is split up into User stories, and realised through sprints. They originally just explain the desired outcome with requirements added later on in the process.
- The larger goals (Epic story) are split up into multiple user stories, completed with multiple iterations/Sprints
- All the epic stories together make up the initiative

# Why create user stories
- Stories keep the focus on the user
- Stories enable collaboration
- Stories drive creative solutions
- Stories create momentum
