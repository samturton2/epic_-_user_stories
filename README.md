# Epic Story

## What is an epic story?
An epic is a large story that cannot be delivered with one iteration, So has to be split into smaller ones.
- Use Cases:
  - When working in a scrum framework and one of the sprints cannot be completed within the dedicated timeframe
  - when there is value in having a simple hierachy in your product backlog

## What are User stories?
When a team divides up the work into functional increments called "User Stories"
- Use Cases:
  - When programming a large project its often useful to define the project scope with user stories

## How to Epic and User Stories fit in with Agile and Scrum?
- The scrum backlog is split up into User stories, with the User stories completed using sprints.
- If the User story is too large (Epic story) it has to be split up into multiple iterations/Sprints
